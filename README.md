# Community-Bud

This project was my first website. So it may seem quite messy and some files may be redundant.

## Description
The aim of the project was to create a website for teacher-student interaction. The website was developed with php and mysql using wamp.
The Project.rar file contains the source code for the website and the Dump sql file contains the database schema.

## Functionalities

Registration and login - for teachers and students.
All users have profile picture which they can edit.
Teachers can make announcemnts, upload files (attendance and marks).
Students can view these announcements and files and can also discuss in forums.
Each forum discussion will have a main topic and comments on that topic (One level comments).
